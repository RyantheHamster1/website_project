    <h2>About Boomer</h2>
    <p>This is my dog Boomer, he is over three years old and is a Shih Tzu mix. He's super crazy and barks at literally everything for some reason but I love him anyways.</p>

    <h3>Why I love Boomer</h3>
    <p>I love Boomer a ton cause he's super cute and he's really fun to play with. Whenever I go downstairs it's always comforting to just lay down on the couch with him and chill. Until he finds something to start barking at.</p>
